	database relational table model or vice versa.

	 the row or the updated time of the row

5- namedQuery--through namedQuery we have not write the whole query again and again 
	we hve to give a query to a name and when we need that we just use that name.

6- namedQueries--through this we can write multiple namedQuery for that we have to put
	 namedQuery with annotaion to namedQueries.

7- native Query is the basic sql query we can also write in java.

8- In one to one mapping we have to create one table as main table and one is secondary we can
	create any table as main and in main table we have to write the class name of the secondary table
	in java file. and annotate it as onetoone.And also we have to create the column of secondary table
	primary key as foreign key in main table in sql.

9- In Bidirectional wehave to create the vriable of primary class in secondary class and annotate it
	by one to one mappedBy-secondary class variable name which we create in the main class.
